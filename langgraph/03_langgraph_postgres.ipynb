    "LangGraph has a built-in persistence layer, implemented through checkpointers. When you compile a graph with a checkpointer, the checkpointer saves a `checkpoint` of the graph state at every super-step. Those checkpoints are saved to a `thread`, which can be accessed after graph execution. Because `threads` allow access to graph's state after execution, several powerful capabilities including human-in-the-loop, memory, time travel, and fault-tolerance are all possible. Below, we'll discuss each of these concepts in more detail."

    "Under the hood, checkpointing is powered by checkpointer objects that conform to [BaseCheckpointSaver](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver) interface. LangGraph provides several checkpointer implementations, all implemented via standalone, installable libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `langgraph-checkpoint`: The base interface for checkpointer savers ([BaseCheckpointSaver](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver)) and serialization/deserialization interface ([SerializerProtocol](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.base.SerializerProtocol)). Includes in-memory checkpointer implementation ([InMemorySaver](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.memory.InMemorySaver)) for experimentation. LangGraph comes with `langgraph-checkpoint` included.\n",
    "* `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite`: An implementation of LangGraph checkpointer that uses SQLite database ([SqliteSaver](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.SqliteSaver) / [AsyncSqliteSaver](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.aio.AsyncSqliteSaver)). Ideal for experimentation and local workflows. Needs to be installed separately.\n",
    "* `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`: An advanced checkpointer that uses Postgres database ([PostgresSaver](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.PostgresSaver) / [AsyncPostgresSaver](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.aio.AsyncPostgresSaver)), used in LangGraph Platform. Ideal for using in production. Needs to be installed separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checkpointer interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Each checkpointer conforms to [BaseCheckpointSaver](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.base.BaseCheckpointSaver) interface and implements the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.put` - Store a checkpoint with its configuration and metadata.\n",
    "* `.put_writes` - Store intermediate writes linked to a checkpoint (i.e. [pending writes](#pending-writes)).\n",
    "* `.get_tuple` - Fetch a checkpoint tuple using for a given configuration (`thread_id` and `checkpoint_id`). This is used to populate `StateSnapshot` in `graph.get_state()`.\n",
    "* `.list` - List checkpoints that match a given configuration and filter criteria. This is used to populate state history in `graph.get_state_history()`\n",
    "\n",
    "If the checkpointer is used with asynchronous graph execution (i.e. executing the graph via `.ainvoke`, `.astream`, `.abatch`), asynchronous versions of the above methods will be used (`.aput`, `.aput_writes`, `.aget_tuple`, `.alist`).\n",
    "\n",
    "<Note>\n",
    "  For running your graph asynchronously, you can use `InMemorySaver`, or async versions of Sqlite/Postgres checkpointers -- `AsyncSqliteSaver` / `AsyncPostgresSaver` checkpointers.\n",
    "</Note>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serializer\n",
    "\n",
    "When checkpointers save the graph state, they need to serialize the channel values in the state. This is done using serializer objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "`langgraph_checkpoint` defines [protocol](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.base.SerializerProtocol) for implementing serializers provides a default implementation ([JsonPlusSerializer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.jsonplus.JsonPlusSerializer)) that handles a wide variety of types, including LangChain and LangGraph primitives, datetimes, enums and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Serialization with `pickle`\n",
    "\n",
    "The default serializer, [`JsonPlusSerializer`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.jsonplus.JsonPlusSerializer), uses ormsgpack and JSON under the hood, which is not suitable for all types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to fallback to pickle for objects not currently supported by our msgpack encoder (such as Pandas dataframes),\n",
    "you can use the `pickle_fallback` argument of the `JsonPlusSerializer`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\n",
    "from langgraph.checkpoint.serde.jsonplus import JsonPlusSerializer\n",
    "\n",
    "# ... Define the graph ...\n",
    "graph.compile(\n",
    "    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(serde=JsonPlusSerializer(pickle_fallback=True))\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkpointers can optionally encrypt all persisted state. To enable this, pass an instance of [`EncryptedSerializer`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.encrypted.EncryptedSerializer) to the `serde` argument of any `BaseCheckpointSaver` implementation. The easiest way to create an encrypted serializer is via [`from_pycryptodome_aes`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.encrypted.EncryptedSerializer.from_pycryptodome_aes), which reads the AES key from the `LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY` environment variable (or accepts a `key` argument):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "from langgraph.checkpoint.serde.encrypted import EncryptedSerializer\n",
    "from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\n",
    "\n",
    "serde = EncryptedSerializer.from_pycryptodome_aes()  # reads LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY\n",
    "checkpointer = SqliteSaver(sqlite3.connect(\"checkpoint.db\"), serde=serde)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.checkpoint.serde.encrypted import EncryptedSerializer\n",
    "from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver\n",
    "\n",
    "serde = EncryptedSerializer.from_pycryptodome_aes()\n",
    "checkpointer = PostgresSaver.from_conn_string(\"postgresql://...\", serde=serde)\n",
    "checkpointer.setup()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When running on LangGraph Platform, encryption is automatically enabled whenever `LANGGRAPH_AES_KEY` is present, so you only need to provide the environment variable. Other encryption schemes can be used by implementing [`CipherProtocol`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/checkpoints/#langgraph.checkpoint.serde.base.CipherProtocol) and supplying it to `EncryptedSerializer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Human-in-the-loop\n",
    "\n",
    "First, checkpointers facilitate [human-in-the-loop workflows](/oss/python/langgraph/add-human-in-the-loop) workflows by allowing humans to inspect, interrupt, and approve graph steps. Checkpointers are needed for these workflows as the human has to be able to view the state of a graph at any point in time, and the graph has to be to resume execution after the human has made any updates to the state. See [the how-to guides](/oss/python/langgraph/add-human-in-the-loop) for examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, checkpointers allow for [\"memory\"](/oss/python/concepts/memory) between interactions. In the case of repeated human interactions (like conversations) any follow up messages can be sent to that thread, which will retain its memory of previous ones. See [Add memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory) for information on how to add and manage conversation memory using checkpointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Travel\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, checkpointers allow for [\"time travel\"](/oss/python/langgraph/use-time-travel), allowing users to replay prior graph executions to review and / or debug specific graph steps. In addition, checkpointers make it possible to fork the graph state at arbitrary checkpoints to explore alternative trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fault-tolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, checkpointing also provides fault-tolerance and error recovery: if one or more nodes fail at a given superstep, you can restart your graph from the last successful step. Additionally, when a graph node fails mid-execution at a given superstep, LangGraph stores pending checkpoint writes from any other nodes that completed successfully at that superstep, so that whenever we resume graph execution from that superstep we don't re-run the successful nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pending writes\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, when a graph node fails mid-execution at a given superstep, LangGraph stores pending checkpoint writes from any other nodes that completed successfully at that superstep, so that whenever we resume graph execution from that superstep we don't re-run the successful nodes."
